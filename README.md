The purpose of this bot is to get an Nvidia card. It tries multiple things to do that.

- Currently, `nvidia-snatcher` is not capable of purchasing a card for you
- Scrapes multiple websites for patterns of being stocked
    - API requests are a work in progress (very soon)
- Opens browser when stock is available
- Sends an email to you when stock is avaiable (must have Gmail)

> :point_right: You may get false positives from time to time, so I apologize for that. The library currently waits for all calls to be completed before parsing, but sometimes this can have unknown behavior. Patience is a virtue :)

## Installation and prerequisites

Linux, macOS, and Windows are all capable operating systems.

You do not need any computer skills, smarts, or anything of that nature. You are very capable as you have made it this far. Some basic understanding how a terminal, git, and or Node.js is a bonus, but that does not limit you to getting `nvidia-snatcher` running!

### Quick overview

- [Node.js 14](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Clone this project `git clone https://github.com/jef/nvidia-snatcher.git`
- Run `npm install`
- Copy `.env.example` to a new file `.env` and edit the `.env` file to your liking using your [favorite text editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - More on this in [customization](#Customization)

At any point you want the program to stop, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.
