The purpose of this bot is to get an Nvidia card. It tries multiple things to do that.

- Currently, `nvidia-snatcher` is not capable of purchasing a card for you
- Scrapes multiple websites for patterns of being stocked
    - API requests are a work in progress (very soon)
- Opens browser when stock is available
- Sends an email to you when stock is avaiable (must have Gmail)

> :point_right: You may get false positives from time to time, so I apologize for that. The library currently waits for all calls to be completed before parsing, but sometimes this can have unknown behavior. Patience is a virtue :)

| | **Best Buy** | **B&H** | **Newegg** | **Nvidia** | **EVGA** | **Amazon** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

> :point_right: (`â„¹`) Work in progress. Catchpa problems are intermittent. Use if you'd like, but expect problems.

## Installation and prerequisites

Linux, macOS, and Windows are all capable operating systems.

You do not need any computer skills, smarts, or anything of that nature. You are very capable as you have made it this far. Some basic understanding how a terminal, git, and or Node.js is a bonus, but that does not limit you to getting `nvidia-snatcher` running!

### Quick overview

- [Node.js 14](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Clone this project `git clone https://github.com/jef/nvidia-snatcher.git`
- Run `npm install`
- Copy `.env.example` to a new file `.env` and edit the `.env` file to your liking using your [favorite text editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - More on this in [customization](#Customization)
- Run `npm run start` to start

At any point you want the program to stop, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.

> :point_right: Please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/jef/nvidia-snatcher/wiki) if you need more help with installation.

### Customization

There is not much to configure (as of now), but there are some options that you can choose to utilize.

First, you're going to need to copy the `.env.example` to `.env`. The current options are:

| **Environment variable** | **Description** |
|:---:|:---:|
| `EMAIL_USERNAME` | Gmail address (e.g., `jensen.robbed.us@gmail.com`); optional |
| `EMAIL_PASSWORD` | Gmail password; see below if you have MFA; optional |
| `NOTIFICATION_TEST` | Test all the notifications configured; optional, default: `false` |
| `PAGE_TIMEOUT` | Navigation Timeout in milliseconds (`0` for infinite); optional, default: `30000` |
| `PHONE_NUMBER` | 10 digit phone number, only USA, SMS may apply (e.g., `1234567890`); optional, email configuration required |
| `PHONE_CARRIER` | Service provider for SMS, supports `["sprint", "tmobile", "att", "verizon", "google"]`; optional, email configuration required |
| `RATE_LIMIT_TIMEOUT` | Rate limit timeout for each full store cycle; optional, default: `5000` |
| `SLACK_CHANNEL` | Slack channel for posting (e.g., `update`); optional |
| `SLACK_TOKEN` | Slack API token; optional
| `STORES` | List of [stores](#Supported-stores) you want to be scraped; optional, default: `nvidia` |
| `OPEN_BROWSER` | Toggle for whether or not the browser should open when item is found, default: `true` |
| `PLAY_SOUND` | Play this sound notification if a card is found.; optional |
| `SCREENSHOT` | Capture screenshot of page on successful hit; optional, default `true` |

> :point_right: If you have multi-factor authentication (MFA), you will need to create an [app password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) and use this instead of your Gmail password.

> :point_right: Free sounds available [here](https://freesound.org/home/). Place sounds into `resources/sounds/`
