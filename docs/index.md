## Features

First and foremost, this service _will not_ automatically buy for you.

- **Checks stock continuously** -- runs 24/7, 365, looking for the items you want.
- **Ready for checkout** -- ability to add to cart when available and even opens the browser for you.
- **Notifications galore** -- when you're not by your computer, worry free with notifications to most platforms and devices when an item comes in stock.

## Getting started

You'll find most of the content on the left sidebar. The right sidebar will help you navigate a page.
