???+ info
    You can also have a list of proxies that are rotated while searching stores. Proxies can be read from a file named `STORENAME.proxies` in the format of `socks5://username:password@ip`; one per line. In this case, there is no need to use the `PROXY_*` environments.

    - You can also have a list of proxies that are rotated while searching stores. Proxies can be read from a file named `STORENAME.proxies` in the format of `socks5://username:password@ip`; one per line.
    - Data usage is [known to be high](https://github.com/jef/streetmerchant/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated-desc+bandwidth). This is expected as the program scrapes many websites in parallel 24/7. To help reduce this, use `LOW_BANDWIDTH="true"`. We are looking into other solutions as well, but is low priority.
